      <dt>About</dt>
      <dd>Github Visualizer was built as part of the Georgia Tech CS 7450 class. This is a visualization of an organizations repositories and users simultaniously. For this example we have used data from <a href="http://www.balancedpayments.com/" target='_blank'>Balanced</a>.</dd>

      <dt>Source Code</dt>
      <dd>The source code can be downloaded from <a href="http://github.com/sb2nov/GithubVisualizer" target='_blank'>http://github.com/sb2nov/GithubVisualizer</a>. All the code for the project is under an MIT license. The data was created using the Github API.</dd>

      <dt>Usage</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>At the start of the app you will see all the data for the project loaded. The bar chart is set to the complete time scale. The Y-Axis is set to use the number of commits as the scale. This can be changed using the Main Variable dropdown in the top right corner. We can select a particular time frame by selecting a region the red graph below the timeline.</p>
        <p>
          Currently the treemap and the heatmap are set to the global view of the complete organization. We can analyze a particular user or repository by clicking an appropriate tile on the tree map. </p>
        <p>
          When you click a repository tile, the user map is updated to present the details of that particular repository, same for the heat map. The time line would present a Lightpick overlay on top of the blue bars. This shows the percentage of contribution to this particular repository compared to the complete organization. </p>
        <p>
          Similarly vice-versa would happen if you click a user tile. In the navigation bar we append the selection as a button to create a link to the actual github page for the repository or the user. Clicking on the home button on the bar would refresh your selection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now suppose you clicked a user first and then clicked on a repository. So your selection is a particular repository and user. This would be reflected as a green overlay on the timeline. So your timeline would have three layers now. A link in the navigation bar can take you to the commit log of the selected user in the selected repository.
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt>Data Processing</dt>
      <dd>The data was fetched using Github's API using a python script. It was then stored into csv files for the visualization to use it. We also aggregated the repositories under a threshold into Small Projects. And users below a certain threshold into External User.</dd>
      <dt>Feedback</dt>
